<!--Welcome to "Projects Fuego..." Just follow along with comments like this one, and you'll design a really cool webtext that not only introduces you, your skills, and interests to the rest of the class, but also builds your coding literacy. Refer to the repository README for GitHub publishing help.-->

<!--BTW. You can leave these faded code comments be, or delete them. Programmers and web designers use these comments to better explain what the code is doing for others who may enter the document later. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

  <!--Next comes the <head> information including the title and all of the important links that make the webtext work. When a browser access your url, it looks first at the index.html document <head> to learn about the names and locations of the other files and assets it will need to assemble your code into a visual display.-->

  <!--Go ahead and fill in the blank in <title>I am...</title> (see just below). The <title> will appear in your document's browser tab-->

<!--Next is a link to the cascading style sheet or CSS. Web designers use a cascading stylesheet CSS to add styling to a website. Designers do this by "calling" a <div class> in HTML and defining the class attributes on the style sheet. Doing so saves time and results in less code. On the style.css page you'll find attributes relating font, text size, image size, among other details.-->

<!--Now we will start working in the body of the document. The body holds all of the code and content that will appear as a visual for our audience.-->

<!--Designers refer to this next section as a "Hero Image." The hero image is styled on the style.css page by calling a "class." To replace the hero image, simply place a .jpg file in the same file folder (directory) as this project and name it "hero.jpg." Alternatively, if you are working with a .png, you will need to open the style.css file using your text editor, find the "hero-image" class and change the file type from ".jpg" to ".png."" Browsers will only work with .jpg, .jpeg, or .png images. Since hero images need to stretch across the screen, typically you will want to select an image 1200px in width to allow quick load time yet avoid pixilation.-->

<!--Fuego programs sometimes use "in-line styling" to provide quick fixes to content design. In the above case, you could change "left" to "right" or "center" depending on your specific design needs. That said, left align is usually best practice for improving readability.-->

  <h2>So...What Am I Doing With My Life? </h2>
  <h3>I am a part-time, non-traditional Sophomore at the College of General Studies. I enjoy learning about text, art, media, and design. My favorite courses so far have been:
    <div class= "ul" style="text-align: left">
      <li>Digital Photography</li>
      <li>Introduction to Journalism</li>
      <li>Intro to Computer Programing: Visual Basic</li>
</div>
     <p>I have added new goals to my educational journey as I have taken courses that I have enjoyed! </p>

     <p>I hope that I continue to find subjects that will compliment my futrure asperations.</p></h3>

<!--Replace the images here. You can also control max-image width%. Keep your file names simple, don't use spaces, and be case sensitive). Be sure to add alt="text." Visually impaired individuals using screen readers rely on alt="text" to describe pictures to them. Describe your image as clearly and succinctly as possible.-->

  <h2>What I Know, What I Can Do, and Unique Skills (that kinda pay the bills):</h2>
    <h3> 
    <p>I am a life-long maker, designer, artist, writer, student, and explorer!</p> 

    <p>For over 20 years I have been a professional barber and cosmetology educator. This path has lead me to work in several post secondary institutions, and I currently work with non-traditional students in the University of Pittsburgh's College of General Studies! </p>
       
    <p>I have a passion for people and their stories - cementing interveiwing, writing and photojournalism as my favorite mediums. I hope to explore new ways to share those stories! </p>
        
   <p>Last term I took my first coding class - Visual Basic - and I want to blend those skills with writing and photography. I hope to grow my career at Pitt, and explore designing and teaching on-line courses for non-traditional students.</p> </h3>

<!--So, what exactly is good design? Take some time to explain your design interests...defining it, providing examples, explaining why is it important/significant-->
<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>What Do I Think Good Design Looks Like?</h2>
      <h3><p>First and foremost, Good Design has a clear and specific purpose - addressing a common problem that many people will relate to. That’s where every good product begins! </p> 
        
       <p>Not only does it provide a welcome solution to that problem; it does so in a way that’s intuitive, engaging, and highly motivational. There are many diffrent ways to look at design.</p>  
         
      <p>Web design should be simple and easy to use with a clear, straightforward interface, straightforward language, and deliberate absence of distracting visuals - making it accessible for everyone. Print design might focuses on the layout, typography, and artwork in publications - setting the tone for anything that involves the written word! Environmental design connects people to places - making them memorable or informative. This includes signage,  murals, and navigation. </p> 
         
     <p>Designers combine many different types of design, including programing, architectural, product, and industrial design, with graphic design to implement their work!</p>  </h3>
  </div>

<!--Replace the images here with examples of good design.-->
